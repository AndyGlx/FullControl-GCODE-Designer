These parametric design files allow you to create GCode for almost any printer that accepts GCode, but make sure you set up the start/end GCode for your printer as described in the New Printer tutorial on my website (http://fullcontrolgcode.com/tutorials) 

There are two files:

 - One is for creating structures with parametric ripples and geometry (or for ramen-noodle-like structures if you change the layer height and extrusion appropriately) - it's the file called "FullControl_GCODE_Designer_Heron02b_RippleRamen#1.xlsm"

 - The other one is for creating a wide range of different vase-like structures (without ripple texture) by changing a few parameters - it's the file called "FullControl_GCODE_Designer_Heron02b_FullControlParametricVase#1.xlsm"

Follow the instructions on the main sheet in each design file and check that you can create GCode like that in the example print path screenshots I've included.
Try copy and pasting the demo parameter sets Iâ€™ve given and then explore modifying the parameters yourself.

Make a request for additional design features on github or by emailing info@fullcontrolgcode.com

Any feedback would be very much appreciated about these designs. E.g. whether they are easy/difficult to understand, etc. Or any technical issues.
